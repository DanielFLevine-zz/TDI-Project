## Overview
This project is the first part of a larger project that aims to predict sentiment from Twitch chatrooms. Our goal here is to provide a simple example of how this can be done. We proceed by cleaning our data and using a bidirection LSTM neural network. In the future, we will explore model selection, optimize parameters, and develop a user interface to make the analysis accessible and digestible.

## Data
The data used can be found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VE0IVQ).
